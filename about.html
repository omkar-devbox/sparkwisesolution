                    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="story-intro">Sparkwise is a fast-growing AI startup born from a simple observation: while AI technology was advancing rapidly, most businesses couldn't access its benefits. The tools were too complex, the barriers too high, and the results too uncertain.</p>
                    <p class="story-body">As a team of engineers and entrepreneurs who had worked with AI for years, we saw firsthand how difficult it was to build and deploy computer vision solutions. Even with technical expertise, the process was slow, expensive, and often failed to deliver real business value.</p>
                    <p class="story-body">We founded Sparkwise as a startup to change that. Our mission is to make enterprise-grade AI accessible to every business that needs it—without requiring a team of PhDs or months of development time. We believe that if we can simplify the technology while maintaining its power, we can help companies transform their operations.</p>
                    <p class="story-body">Today, we're proud to work with manufacturers, automotive companies, FMCG brands, and medical device companies who trust us with their quality control, inspection, and automation needs. But we're just getting started. Every day, we're learning from our customers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.</p>
                    <p class="story-closing">This isn't just our company—it's our commitment to making AI work for everyone.</p>

Where manufacturers can guarantee product quality at scale, where defects are caught before they reach customers, and where human expertise is amplified by AI rather than replaced by it. We're building the platform that makes this vision a reality.</p>

                <div class="why-exist-text">
                    <p class="why-intro">The world is producing more goods than ever before, and quality expectations are higher than ever. Yet most quality control still relies on human inspection—a process that's slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale.</p>
                    <p class="why-body">We exist because this gap between what's possible and what's practical shouldn't exist. AI technology has reached a point where it can reliably detect defects, verify components, and ensure quality at speeds and accuracy levels that humans simply cannot match.</p>
                    <p class="why-body">But technology alone isn't enough. Companies need solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows, that don't require specialized expertise to operate, and that deliver measurable business results from day one.</p>
                    <p class="why-body">That's where we come in. We're not just building AI models—we're building the bridge between cutting-edge technology and real-world business needs. We're making it possible for a quality manager to deploy an AI inspection system without writing a single line of code. We're making it possible for a manufacturer to catch 100% of defects without hiring an army of inspectors.</p>
                    <p class="why-closing">We exist because the future of manufacturing, quality control, and industrial automation is AI-powered—and that future should be accessible to everyone.</p>
